<h1>Grand Theft Auto Online Data Analysis (Personal Project) üèéÔ∏è</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<li>An individual data analysis project I worked on in Python with a dataset of GTA Online player's activity over 3 months, where I was able to determine
  the spending activity of players in 3 categories (low, medium, and high level). I created data visualizations and confirmed my results using
  IBM SPSS to have a p < 0.01.

<h2>Can I see the results?</h2>
<li>Yes! The link is 
  <a href = "https://github.com/SaulTopete/gta-analysis/blob/main/Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online_%20Data%20Analysis.pdf">here</a>! I created a full presentation
  of my process including:
  <ul>
    <li>Data Visualizations of analyzed data of each level category and spending habit.</li>
    <li>Explanation of data and reasoning of specific trends with outside research.</li>
    <li>Confirmation of statistical significance using IBM SPSS to verify p < 0.01 for each category of spending.</li>
  </ul>
